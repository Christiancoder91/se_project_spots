# Project 3: Spots

This project is designed to be responsive on the three most common screen sizes (desktop, tablet and smartphone). It's a series of images and is designed so that whether the screen size expands or (and especially) shrinks, there is no horizontal scroll bar, just a vertical one.
Besides the basics of designing a page (header, body, footer) and the various ways you can style a page (colors, fonts...ect), this webpage also has various buttons as well as media queries, which enable the page to fit the various size screens in a way that looks good.
